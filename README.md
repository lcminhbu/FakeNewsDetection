# Fake News Detection Project

## Introduction

This is a small project conducted as part of a course at the University of Science, Ho Chi Minh City (HCMUS). The project focuses on building and training a machine learning model to distinguish between real and fake news. After the model is developed, we create a web page where users can input news articles, and the model will determine whether the input news is real or fake.

## Project Overview

- **Machine Learning Model**: We build and train a model for classifying news articles as real or fake.

- **Web Application**: We develop a web application that utilizes the trained model. Users can input news articles, and the application will provide a prediction on the authenticity of the news.
